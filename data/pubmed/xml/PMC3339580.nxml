Direct red 80 under anoxic conditions within 12&#x000a0;h and also degrade the reaction intermediates (aromatic amines) during the subsequent 12&#x000a0;h under aerobic conditions. The tubular gel harboring the immobilized cells consisted of anoxic and aerobic regions integrated in a single unit which was ideal for azo dye degradation studies. Results obtained show that effective dye decolorization (97.8%), chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction (91.7%) and total aromatic amines removal were obtained in 15&#x000a0;h with the immobilized bacterial cell system whereas for the free cells, a hydraulic residence time of 24&#x000a0;h was required for an equivalent performance in a sequential anoxic and aerobic process. Repeated-batch experiments indicate the immobilized cells could decolorize C.I.

These dyes dominate the worldwide market of dyestuffs with a share of about 70% (Mishra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2011</xref>), making them the largest group of synthetic colorants and the most common dyes released into the environment (Saratale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2009a</xref>; Zhao and Hardin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2007</xref>). During dye processing, as much as 2&#x02013;50% of dyestuffs applied during dyeing of different substrates, such as synthetic and natural textile fibers, plastics, leather, paper, mineral oils, waxes, foodstuffs and cosmetics are wasted with spent dye baths due to their imperfect fixing properties (Tezcanli-G&#x000fc;yer and Ince <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2004</xref>). If the wasted dye baths are channeled to the rest of the plant&#x02019;s wastewater streams for treatment by conventional biochemical operations, the azo dyes may go through the system without degradation and ultimately reach the receiving water with the potential to produce carcinogenic amines under anaerobic conditions (Eren and Ince <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010</xref>). In addition, the strong color of discharged dyes even at very small concentrations has a huge impact on the aquatic environment since it has negative ecotoxicological effects on fauna, affects esthetic merit and results in reduction in light penetration and photosynthesis, thus posing pollution problems (Aksu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2007</xref>; Manu and Chaudhari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2002</xref>). Therefore, adequate treatment of textile dyeing process effluents is imperative in order to remove these dyes and their reduction metabolites prior to their final discharge to the environment.</p><p>In the recent past, efforts have been made to develop efficient and sustainable methods for treatment of dye wastewater due to rigorous government legislations holding textile industries to increasingly higher standards of treatment regarding waste effluents (Corso and de Almeida <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>). Emerging technologies developed based on physical and chemical treatment methods for the removal of azo dyes from wastewater (Ai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2010</xref>; Khataee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2009</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2009</xref>) were successful in some cases. However, these methods have not been widely applied because of their high cost, inability to completely remove the recalcitrant azo dyes and/or their organic metabolites and the secondary pollution that can be generated by the excessive use of chemicals (Forgacs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2004</xref>) Consequently, microbial degradation has been suggested as a viable alternative due to its eco-friendly nature and cost-competitiveness when compared to physicochemical treatment methods (Jadhav et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>; Saratale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2010</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of bacterial degradation of azo dyes involves the reductive cleavage of azo bonds (&#x02013;N=N&#x02013;). This occurs with the help of azo reductase enzymes when carriers in the electron transport chain utilize azo compounds as terminal electron acceptors under anaerobic conditions which results in the formation of colorless solutions containing aromatic amines (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2007</xref>; Van der Zee and Villaverde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2005</xref>). This process is repressed by the presence of oxygen through its inhibition of the azo bond reduction activity since it is a more energetically favorable oxidizing agent. Hence, it is essential that bacterial decolorization is operated under nearly anaerobic conditions. However, aromatic amines resulting from the decolorization process in the anaerobic treatment are not mineralized under anaerobic conditions and tend to accumulate to toxic levels (Gottlieb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2003</xref>; Luangdilok and Panswad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2000</xref>). Some of these aromatic amines are known to be cytotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic (Alves de Lima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2007</xref>; Mansour et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>) and would therefore pose a serious hazard if released into the aquatic environment untreated. Conventional processes for the removal of aromatic amines from industrial wastewaters include extraction, adsorption onto activated carbon, chemical oxidation, electrochemical techniques and irradiation. All of these methods suffer from drawbacks including high costs, formation of hazardous by-products and low efficiency (Gianfreda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>). Therefore, for the decomposition and removal of these putatively toxic and recalcitrant compounds, anaerobic biological treatment of dye wastewater will have to be followed by aerobic treatment (Libra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2004</xref>). This observation has led to the proposal that anaerobic/aerobic systems might be effective in achieving the complete biodegradation of azo dyes.</p><p>In the last few years, several laboratory-scale sequential anaerobic/aerobic processes for the treatment of wastewater containing azo dyes have been described. Supaka et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2004</xref>) showed that the aerobic stage of combined anaerobic/aerobic treatment of dye wastes eliminated the chemical oxygen demand (COD), attributed to removal of the aromatic amines, which are anaerobically recalcitrant. The removal of aromatic amines was also evaluated during the decolorization of C.I. Direct black 38 dye using an anaerobic upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) and an aerobic completely stirred tank reactor system (CSTR). Results obtained indicated that the total aromatic amines (TAAs) produced under anaerobic conditions were ultimately removed in the aerobic stage and aromatic amine recoveries such as 45&#x02013;50% were obtained in the aerobic reactor (Sponza and Isik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2005</xref>). In another report, a sequential anaerobic/aerobic system was also used to treat a simulated textile wastewater containing azo dyes in which a significant part of TAAs was removed successfully in the sequential aerobic stage (Isik and Sponza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>). Sequencing batch reactors (SBR) and other reactor types such as fluidized bed and packed bed reactors have also been used in recent studies to achieve dye removal (Sponza and Isik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2002</xref>; Ong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2005</xref>). These presently available systems for dye degradation consists of two biological conversion steps (aerobic and anaerobic degradation), and require a large space for the aerobic and anaerobic units along with complicated operations. If the aerobic and anaerobic systems occurred in the same unit, dye removal systems would be simplified.</p><p>In this study, we discuss the partial mineralization of C.I. Direct red 80, a polyazo dye, in a single unit and compact aerobic and anoxic bioreactor system with simple operation and consisting of immobilized bacteria in tubular polymeric gel. The tubular gel has two regions: one region (near outer surfaces) of the tube contacts aerobically with the medium whereas, the other region (within tubular gel) remains anoxic. Azo dye partial mineralization in this integrated system occurred through the reductive cleavage of azo bonds in the anoxic region and the subsequent degradation of the resulting aromatic amines in the aerobic region of the tubular gel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals</title><p>The polyazo dye (C.I.

Direct red 80 under aerobic and anoxic conditions. Results obtained show that extensive decolorization of the dye by the bacterial isolate was obtained when decolorization assay was performed under anoxic conditions while incubation under aerobiosis resulted in poor decolorizaton of dye (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). At 12&#x000a0;h of incubation under anoxic conditions, the dye decolorization extent was 93% while complete decolorization of the dye was obtained after 15&#x000a0;h. However, under aerobic conditions, only 11.2% decolorization of the dye was obtained after 15&#x000a0;h of incubation. This clearly indicates that the decolorization of the polyazo dye by <italic>B. firmus</italic> was more efficient under anoxic conditions rather than under aerobiosis. The first step in the bacterial degradation of azo dyes is the reduction of the &#x02013;N=N&#x02013; bond which results in decolorization. This reaction is usually catalyzed by the oxygen sensitive enzyme, azoreductase, which is produced constitutively in dye degrading bacterial strains (Pandey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>). Hence, the effective decolorization of C.I. Direct red 80 in this study under anoxic conditions may be attributed to the cleavage of the chromophoric azo bonds of the polyazo dye by the azoreductase of <italic>B. firmus.</italic> The structural makeup of C.I. Direct red 80 may have contributed to its poor biodegradation under aerobiosis as azo dyes containing mainly nitro and sulfonic groups have been reported to be recalcitrant to aerobic bacterial degradation (Claus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2002</xref>). This fact is probably related to the electron-withdrawing nature of the azo bond and their resistance to oxygenases attack. As anaerobic color removal occurs by the way of reduction of the azo dye, which acts a final electron acceptor in the microbial electron transport chain, existing and more effective electron acceptors like oxygen in the medium could act as a limiting factor for dye removal (&#x000c7;inar and Demir&#x000f6;z <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>). Similar results were obtained in studies on pure bacterial strains such as <italic>Pseudomonas luteola, Pseudomonas</italic> sp. <italic>SUK1</italic> and <italic>Micrococcus glutamicus NCIM</italic>-<italic>216</italic>8 (Chang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2001</xref>; Kalyani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>; Saratale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2009b</xref>). The biodegradation of the azo dye C.I. Acid orange 7 by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. OX1 was studied under a variety of operating conditions and it was found that the decolorization potential of the microorganism was fully exploited only in the absence of oxygen (Lodato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>). In another study, Forgacs et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>) also observed that the efficiency of aerobic treatment is inferior to that of anaerobic decolorization process. These earlier reports suggested that aeration and agitation, which increases the concentration of oxygen in the solution, should be avoided for efficient color removal. Nevertheless, the intermediate products (carcinogenic aromatic amines) generated from anaerobic breakdown of azo dyes have to be degraded by an aerobic process (Forgacs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Decolourization extent obtained during degradation of C.I. Direct red 80 by <italic>Bacillus firmus</italic> under anoxic and aerobic conditions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2011_35_Fig3_HTML" id="d29e669"/></fig></p><p>In another experiment carried out to determine the fate of aromatic amines generated during the break down of the polyazo dye, results obtained show that the aromatic amines were persistent under anaerobic conditions even after prolonged incubation (data not shown) and were only degraded by the bacterial cells when they were kept under aerobic conditions in a two-cycle operation during a sequential anoxic&#x02013;aerobic biodegradation tests. Filtrates obtained using a membrane filter (0.45-&#x003bc;m pore size) after anoxic incubation and kept under aerobic conditions did not show reduction in TAA suggesting that the aromatic amines were not autoxidized in the presence of oxygen. As presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, TAA levels increased from 4.2 to 23.8&#x000a0;mg/L during the anoxic process (first 12&#x000a0;h) while a slow reduction in COD (7.2%) was obtained during same process. However, the onset of aerobiosis (12&#x02013;24&#x000a0;h) resulted in a significant reduction in TAA (from 23.8 to 3.0&#x000a0;mg/L) and a marked reduction in COD to a total of 89.8% from 7.2% initially obtained during the anoxic phase, thus indicating the preference of an aerobic environment by the bacterium for the breakdown of the generated aromatic amine intermediates. Similarly, Isik and Sponza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>) found that azo dyes (C.I. Reactive black 5, C.I. Direct red 28, C.I. Direct black 38, C.I. Direct brown 2 and C.I. Direct yellow 12) could be decolorized under reductive anaerobic conditions in very short hydraulic residence times but the breakdown products were not ultimately metabolized and accumulated under anaerobic conditions. However, in the sequential aerobic stage, the significant part of TAA was removed successfully with removal efficiencies of 70&#x02013;85% obtained at total hydraulic residence times of 8.85&#x000a0;days. Tan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2000</xref>) found that C.I. Mordant yellow 10 was reductively cleaved and the resulting aromatic amines, 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphanilic acid, were both recovered under anaerobic conditions. These aromatic amines were ultimately mineralized under aerobic conditions. In another study performed by Isik and Sponza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2003</xref>), it was reported that an anaerobic (upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor)/aerobic (completely stirred tank reactor) sequential reactor system was used to remove 88% COD, 99% color and 91% TAA in synthetic wastewater containing Congo red dye. The TAA produced under anaerobic conditions was ultimately removed in the aerobic stage, resulting in very low aromatic amine recoveries (5&#x02013;18%) in the last one. It had also been previously reported that aromatic amines can be mineralized by means of aerobic treatment by non-specific enzymes via hydroxylation and ring-opening in the presence of oxygen (Chang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2001</xref>; Pandey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>). Usually, the reductive cleavage of the azo bond dissipates the electron deficiency of the aromatic nuclei so that the aromatic amino compounds generated may be subject to subsequent oxidation and mineralization (Forgacs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>). Hence, previous reports have suggested using an anaerobic process with a subsequent aerobic treatment for the removal of azo dyes in wastewater and to improve the biodegradability of generated aromatic amines prior to their final discharge to the environment (Khehra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>; You and Teng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2009</xref>). The results of this study further corroborate the fact that the breakdown of aromatic amines generated from azo dyes occurs via biodegradation under aerobic conditions.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Phase-curve profiles of % decolourization, % COD reduction and residual TAA concentration during degradation of C.I.

Direct red 80 decolorization and the degradation of the resulting aromatic amines by <italic>B. firmus</italic> was designed in the form of a tubular polymeric gel with immobilized bacteria (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The bacterial cells were entrapped and retained within the gel where they accessed the dye and its degradation intermediates through diffusion. The SEM of the cut tubular gel presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the bacterial cells homogenously dispersed and embedded within the alginate gel. Alginate immobilization is the most commonly used bacterial gel entrapment method for many bioremediation applications (Raja Noor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2006</xref>) and offers several advantages such as protection of bacterial cells against environmental conditions, enhancement of activity in most cases and ensuring good diffusion into the polymer (Galai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>SEM photomicrograph of cells of <italic>Bacillus firmus</italic> entrapped within Ca-alginate matrix of the tubular gel</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2011_35_Fig5_HTML" id="d29e741"/></fig></p><p>Data obtained when the immobilized cell system was used for degradation studies are as presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Results indicate almost complete decolorization of C.I. Direct red 80 was obtained within a hydraulic residence time of 12&#x000a0;h with the immobilized cells. The decolorization extent obtained with the immobilized cell system was 91.8% at an aerobic hydraulic residence time of 12&#x000a0;h, whereas 93.7% was obtained with the free cells at same hydraulic residence time under anoxic conditions. The slight difference in decolorization extents obtained for both systems at 12&#x000a0;h could be attributed to mass transfer diffusion limitation in the polymeric gel. On the other hand, changes in TAA and % COD reduction with time show marked deviations in trends when compared to data obtained during the sequential anoxic&#x02013;aerobic degradation experiments with free cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Increase in TAA was from 4.6 to 9.5 mg/L in 9&#x000a0;h followed by a decrease to 3.5 mg/L after a total aerobic hydraulic residence time of 15&#x000a0;h in the immobilized cell system. Likewise, COD removal was more rapid with immobilized bacteria in tubular polymeric gel than when free cells were used in the sequential anoxic&#x02013;aerobic system. With the immobilized cell system, COD reduction was from 0 to 91.7% at a total aerobic hydraulic residence time of 15&#x000a0;h, whereas with the free cells, % COD reduction was from 0 to 89.8 at a total hydraulic residence time of 24&#x000a0;h with higher COD reduction (82.6%) occurring during the 12-h aerobic incubation phase. Thus, higher COD and TAA removal were obtained with immobilized cells of <italic>B. firmus</italic> when compared to the free cells. The existence of anoxic and aerobic regions within the tubular polymeric gel may have been instrumental to the rapid degradation of C.I. Direct red 80 and its resulting aromatic amines by the immobilized bacterial cells, thus leading to COD removal and partial mineralization of the dye. Owing to the low solubility of oxygen in water and the high local cell density, oxygen transfer often becomes limiting and results in the creation of an anoxic center. The dye was probably decolorized at the anoxic center of the gel while the aromatic amines were degraded at the outer aerobic zones of the gel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), thus presenting the use of immobilized bacteria in tubular polymeric gel as an effective method of achieving both anoxic and aerobic environments in one integrated process. The drop in % COD reduction in the free-cell system between anoxic hydraulic residence times of 9 and 12&#x000a0;h may have been due to the accumulation of small organic compounds (metabolites of azo bond cleavage) that are recalcitrant to anoxic degradation but easily amenable to oxidative degradation, thus resulting in an increased COD value. HPLC chromatographs obtained during the course of the experiment with the immobilized cell system show a decrease in aromatic amine peak obtained with time suggesting partial mineralization of C.I. Direct red 80 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). At 6-h hydraulic residence time, an intermediate metabolite (retention time 1.6&#x000a0;min) accumulated accompanying the increasing decolorization of C.I. Direct red 80. This intermediate metabolite decreased significantly after 12-h hydraulic residence time without the emergence of alternate major peaks in the decolorized medium. However, the chromatographic peaks could not be identified due to unavailability of authentic standards. These results suggest that the azo dye structural bone was degraded. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> shows the UV&#x02013;visible spectral scans obtained at different times (0, 6, 12&#x000a0;h) during the decolorization of C.I. Direct red 80 by the immobilized cell system. The absorbance signature of the azo dye consisted of a major peak in the visible region (at 545&#x000a0;nm) within the range of wavelength scanned (400&#x02013;700&#x000a0;nm). The absorbance spectrum reduced progressively with time and there was no formation of new peaks. A reduction in absorbance in the visible spectrum indicates dye decolorization through cleavage of the chromophoric group (&#x02013;N=N&#x02013;). In addition to decolorization by immobilized cells, adsorption of dye molecules to the gel matrix may also play a role in decolorization experiments. Cell-free tubular polymeric gels were prepared and examined for their non-enzymatic color removal ability using an initial dye concentration of 50&#x000a0;mg/L and results indicate abiotic decolorization extent of less than 5% at equilibrium (data not shown). Hence, physical adsorption of dye to the polymeric gel was neglected when calculating decolorization extent of the immobilized cells.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Profiles of % decolourization, % COD reduction and residual TAA concentration during degradation of C.I.

A similar artificial ecosystem system was used in nitrogen removal in wastewater in which aerobic and anaerobic zones were provided simultaneously within the gel used for nitrification and denitrification processes (Uemoto and Saiki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1996</xref>). The use of immobilized microbial cells has received increasing interest in the field of wastewater treatment. For example, Su et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2009</xref>) used immobilization of anthraquinone and quinine-reducing bacterial consortium via entrapment in calcium alginate to accelerate azo dye biodecolorization. Chen and Lin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>) entrapped a Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas luteola</italic> in beads for azo dye decolorization. Couto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>) used polyurethane foam (PUF), nylon sponge, alginate beads as carrier materials to immobilize white-rot fungus for textile dye decolorization. Immobilized cell systems have the potential to degrade toxic chemicals faster than conventional wastewater treatment systems since high densities of specialized microorganisms are used (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2004</xref>). In this study, results show that the tubular gel bioreactor can effectively degrade C.I. Direct red 80 through an integrated anoxic&#x02013;aerobic process and this is the first demonstration of azo dye partial mineralization using bacterial cells immobilized in a tubular polymeric gel.</p><p>Repeated-batch experiments performed with the immobilized cell system indicated its potentials for reusability. Five consecutive batch runs were carried out and the decolorization extent obtained increased with each successive batch run up to the fifth run (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The % decolorization of C.I. Direct red 80 after the first batch run was 91.2, while decolorization extents obtained after the third and fifth batch runs were 95.6 and 98.8%, respectively. Reduction in COD after each successive batch operation was stable through the five runs. This indicates that the tubular polymeric gel offered stability for bacterial activity and enhanced decolorization upon acclimation due to adaptation effect. However, decrease in decolorization extent and % COD reduction was obtained in successive batch runs beyond the fifth probably due to bulging of the gel and mechanical instability (data not shown). The application of the tubular polymeric gel shows good potentials for separation and recovery of the immobilized bacteria, simplified operation, cost effectiveness and reusability. Suspended cultures are not technically viable for long-term repetitive batch operations due to total washout of microbial cells during operation. Reasons for reusability of immobilized cell systems have been deduced by many authors. Roukas and Kotzekidou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1991</xref>) worked on lactic acid production using immobilized cells and attributed this ability of immobilized cells to produce lactic acid for a long time to the protection of cells by the immobilization matrix. In another report, the enhanced performance of immobilized cells as compared to free cells and their ability to retain metabolic activities for a long time were attributed to the maintenance of high cell density without washout in bioreactors, the tendency for higher activity, and the tolerance of bound-cell systems to perturbations in the reaction environment and to toxic substances present in the liquid medium (Couto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>). High cell densities within the immobilization matrix and stabilization of activity of strains through prevention of plasmid loss were also advanced as reasons for sustained performance of immobilized cell systems (Cachon and Divies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1993</xref>). In this study, the good polymerization conditions of the calcium alginate gel and the direct role that the calcium plays in cell conservation (Tamponnet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1989</xref>) may have also played a role. During the repeated-batch experiments, slight cell leakage from the tubular gel was observed especially after the third batch run. However, the leakage of cells from the gel did not affect the efficiency of the degradation process or the integrity of the tubular gel up until the fifth run. Other researchers have also reported cell leakage while using Ca-alginate beads (Goksungur and Guvenc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1999</xref>; West and Strohfus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2001</xref>), and many attempts have been made to decrease cell leakage and to improve the stability of Ca-alginate beads through coating of beads with chitosan (Goksungur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>) or treating the beads with poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine, polyethyleneimine, glutaraldehyde or hexamethylenediamine (Bodalo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1997</xref>). It was stated that some of those agents prevented leakage but also caused drastic losses in cell viability. Thus, enhancing the stability of Ca-alginate tubular gel, prevention of cell leakage and the identification of alternative immobilization matrices with good mechanical strength and high rigidity to withstand the high shear condition usually encountered in a process stream could be subjects of further research. Furthermore, the performance of this simple but yet cost-effective technology on a larger scale needs to be evaluated.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;9</label><caption><p>Fed-batch decolorization extents (<bold>a</bold>) and % COD reduction (<bold>b</bold>) obtained during repetitive runs carried out using the immobilized cell system.

The Ca-alginate tubular gel consisted of anoxic and aerobic regions which facilitated the decolorization of azo dyes in the anoxic center and the degradation of resulting aromatic amines from azo bond cleavage at the aerobic region. Data obtained during batch experiments indicated that the tubular polymeric gel was efficient in dye decolorization, COD reduction and TAA removal from medium supplemented with C.I. Direct red 80. Shorter hydraulic residence time (12&#x000a0;h) for color removal, COD reduction and TAA removal was obtained with the immobilized bacterial cell system when compared to the free cells which required a hydraulic residence time of 24&#x000a0;h for an equivalent performance. The adsorption of dye on the Ca-alginate tubular gel was shown to be insignificant, while control experiments showed dye decolorization, COD reduction and TAA removal were due to activities of bacterial cells. Repeated-batch operations were also performed with the immobilized cell system to justify reusability and results obtained indicate its stability and enhanced performance with each successive run on acclimation for five runs. The study data suggest that tubular polymeric gel, utilizing immobilized bacterial cells as biocatalyst, could be used as an integrated aerobic and anoxic system for the partial mineralization of azo dyes. This immobilized cell technology could serve as a reference for the development of bioreactors with an integrated anoxic/aerobic system for treatment of textile industrial wastewater since it offers minimal space requirement, low capital cost and good COD removal efficiency.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the Academy of Science for the Developing World (TWAS) and the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for providing a TWAS-USM Postdoctoral Fellowship to Ogugbue, C.J. to enable him conduct this research study at USM.
